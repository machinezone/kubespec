# RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.
#
# To use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your external, versioned
# struct, and Object in your internal struct. You also need to register your
# various plugin types.
#
# // Internal package:
# type MyAPIObject struct {
# 	runtime.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
# 	MyPlugin runtime.Object `json:"myPlugin"`
# }
# type PluginA struct {
# 	AOption string `json:"aOption"`
# }
#
# // External package:
# type MyAPIObject struct {
# 	runtime.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
# 	MyPlugin runtime.RawExtension `json:"myPlugin"`
# }
# type PluginA struct {
# 	AOption string `json:"aOption"`
# }
#
# // On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:
# {
# 	"kind":"MyAPIObject",
# 	"apiVersion":"v1",
# 	"myPlugin": {
# 		"kind":"PluginA",
# 		"aOption":"foo",
# 	},
# }
#
# So what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into
# your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked.
# The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime
# package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the
# JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it
# in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a
# runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)
class RawExtension(types.Object):
    pass  # FIXME


# Unknown allows api objects with unknown types to be passed-through. This can be used
# to deal with the API objects from a plug-in. Unknown objects still have functioning
# TypeMeta features-- kind, version, etc.
# TODO: Make this object have easy access to field based accessors and settors for
# metadata and field mutatation.
